Docker Instructions:
Make sure you download Docker. 

Docker desktop for windows - 
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

Windows:
You may have to download Docker Toolbox instead of Docker Desktop (do try this first - links mentioned above) if you run Windows and do not have Windows 10 Pro.
https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v19.03.1/DockerToolbox-19.03.1.ex
This will also download VirtualBox if you do not have it.

Important!!:

Make sure you move your cacti65 folder to your C:/Users/your_user/*
Open Docker QuickStart Terminal

Mac:
Open a terminal after you download you kings


Steps:

1. Go to your cacti65 folder, and open cacti.mk:

Replace lines 24-25 with
CXX = g++ -m64
CC  = gcc -m64

2. Download Dockerfile from Files. Make sure you move this to somewhere inside C:/Users/your_user/* as well!

3. Open terminal and run:

mkdir docker_cactilab && mv Dockerfile docker_cactilab && cd docker_cactilab

docker build -t cactilab_image . (if it takes a while, hit enter lol, not sure why)

cd (path to cacti65 folder)
	- You may get a invalid reference format error here
	- Please cd to your C: drive instead

docker run -itv $(pwd):/home/ --name cactilab_container cactilab_image

(Should launch Docker container and home folder should map to the folder you were in before)

cd home
	- So, here if you are not in your cacti65 folder, please cd to it after you cd home

make

4. cacti should be built! Now run the lab assignment according to the instructions

5. After you are done, run:

exit

6. To restart the container, run:

docker start -i cactilab_container
